## Problem

Player A rolls **three** fair six-sided dice; player B rolls **two** fair six-sided dice.  
- If A’s highest roll is strictly greater than B’s highest roll, **A wins \$10** from B.  
- Otherwise (i.e. if A’s max ≤ B’s max), **B wins \$10** from A.  

**Question.** What entry fee (in dollars) should A pay to make the game fair (expected value zero)?

## 1. Distribution of the Maximum

For *k* fair six-sided dice, the probability that the maximum roll equals *m* (where *m* = 1, 2, …, 6) is:
P(max = m) = (m/6)^k – ((m–1)/6)^k


- **A** (k = 3):  P_A(m) = (m/6)^3 – ((m–1)/6)^3
- **B** (k = 2):  P_B(m) = (m/6)^2 – ((m–1)/6)^2

## 2. Probability that A Wins

A wins exactly when A’s maximum exceeds B’s maximum.  Conditioning on A’s max = *i*:

P(A wins) =
sum for i = 1 to 6 of [P_A(i) * P(max_B < i)]

where  
P_A(i) = (i/6)^3 – ((i–1)/6)^3
P(max_B < i) = ((i–1)/6)^2

Carrying out the sum gives:

P(A wins) ≈ 0.47158

## 3. Expected Value (Raw Game)

Let p = P(A wins) ≈ 0.47158.

- If A wins: gain = +\$10 (probability p)  
- If A loses or ties: gain = –\$10 (probability 1–p)

So the expected gain for A is:

E[gain] = 10·p + (–10)·(1–p)
= 10·(2p – 1)
≈ 10·(2·0.47158 – 1)
≈ –0.5684

A’s **average loss** per play is about \$0.5684.

## 4. Fair Entry Fee

Let F be the fee A pays up front.  Then the net expectation to A is:

E_net = (raw E[gain]) – F
= (–0.5684) – F

Setting E_net = 0 for a fair game means:

F = –0.5684

A negative fee means **A should be paid** \$0.5684 to make the game fair.

## Conclusion

**A should receive approximately \$0.57** to play this game so that its expected value is zero.
