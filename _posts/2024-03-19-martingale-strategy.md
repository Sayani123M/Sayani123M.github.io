The martingale strategy is a classic betting system based on doubling down after every loss.

## Concept
- You start with a base bet (e.g., $1)
- After each loss, double your bet
- After a win, return to base bet

## Issues
- Requires infinite capital (unrealistic)
- Risk of catastrophic loss

## Simulation Coming Soon
