  <h1>Momentum Strategy in Crypto Markets</h1>
</div>

Momentum strategies are based on a simple but powerful idea:  
**assets that have recently gone up will likely keep going up**, and those that are falling may continue to drop.

---

## 📈 Core Idea

Buy assets with upward price momentum,  
Sell or short assets with downward momentum.

This exploits behavioral trends in the market—such as herd behavior, delayed information reaction, or institutional follow-through.

---

## 🧠 Why It Works

- Traders tend to **chase performance**.
- Price movements often reflect **lagged information absorption**.
- Momentum persists more in **volatile, speculative assets**, like crypto.

---

## 🐍 Python Example

Here’s a basic momentum signal using 5-period lookback:

```python
# Simple momentum strategy (pseudo-code)
if price[t] > price[t - 5]:
    buy()
else:
    sell()
